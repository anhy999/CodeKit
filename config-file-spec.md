# Introduction

A CodeKit 3 configuration file stores information about a CodeKit Project, its settings, and all the files it contains. 

### Name & Location:
   1. The file must named `config.codekit3` or `.config.codekit3`.
   2. The file must be located in the root Project folder. (The folder added to CodeKit as a Project.)
   
   
### Format:
The config file is JSON.


### Optionality:
There are only two required fields, both of which are top-level properties: `settingsFileVersion` and `creatorBuild`. All other fields in the Config File are optional.


### Case Sensitivity:
Keys are **case-sensitive.** Values are not.


### Sorting:
To prevent extraneous diffs during Git commits, CodeKit alphabetically sorts all keys in the Config File. While this is not a requirement, it is handy for users.


### 64-Bit Integers:
**Certain numbers in the Config File MUST be parsed as 64-bit integers.** 

This is because several numbers are actually bitmask values. The specific numerical values that MUST be treated as 64-bit integers are called out in this documentation.

As of 2019, JavaScript cannot represent 64-bit integers natively. The `Number` type stops at 53-bits of precision because JavaScript is a god-awful language. Fortunately, JavaScript is introducing the `BigInt` type to solve this problem. It is not officially part of the spec right now.

See https://golb.hplar.ch/2019/01/js-bigint-json.html for a workaround.

If you are **writing** a Config File from scratch and the values you intend to store for the properites that MUST be 64-bit integers do not exceed 53 bits of precision, you can safely write the value as a standard `Number`. For example, `fileType` can be set to `2 (2^1)` to represent a `Sass` file or `4096 (2^12)` to represent a `Markdown` file. 

If you are **reading** a Config File, you must treat numbers as 64-bit integers because you do not control whether or not they have bits beyond (2^53) "enabled". It is NOT safe to use `Number` to represent numberical values in this case.

# Top Level Properties

The top level of the Config File is an object of type `{"key": value}`. It looks like this:

```javascript
{
    "AAInfo": "A string generated by CodeKit explaining the purpose of this file to the user",
    
    "buildSteps": [],
    
    "creatorBuild": "31491",
    
    "files": {},
    
    "hooks": [],
    
    "manualImportLinks": {},
    
    "projectAttributes": {},
    
    "projectSettings": {},
    
    "settingsFileVersion": "3"
}
```

### "AAInfo" - `String`
Anything you provide will be overwritten by CodeKit, but you may want to explain that this is a CodeKit configuration file and the app can be downloaded at https://codekitapp.com/

### "buildSteps" - `[{"key": value, ...}, ...]`
This stores information about each Build Step that a user has defined. It is an `Array` of `Objects` of type `{"key" : value}`. [See Details](#build-steps)

### "creatorBuild" - `String` (REQUIRED)
This is the build number for the version of CodeKit that created this file. The number is visible in CodeKit's About window. You MUST supply a **string** that contains a number equal to the version of CodeKit you're targeting. CodeKit will ignore any Config File that is missing this value.

As of August 2019, use `"31491"`, which is CodeKit 3.9.2. This documentation was written against that CodeKit version.

Whatever build number you enter here is the minimum version of CodeKit that your users should have. If your users have an older version of CodeKit, the Config File will still be read and any values that apply in the older version of the app will be used. However, any values that don't apply to the older version of CodeKit (for a feature that does not exist in the older version) will be discarded permanently.

You are guaranteed forward-compatibility. Your Config File will work in any future release of CodeKit and will be automatically migrated to future formats, if needed.

### "files" - `{"key": {"key": value, ...}, ...}`

This is an `Object` that stores settings for each individual file in the Project. [See Details](#files).

### "hooks" - `[{"key": value, ...}, ...]`

This is an `Array` of `Objects` of type `{"key": value}` that store information about each [Hook](https:/codekitapp.com/help/hooks/) that is defined for this Project. [See Details](#hooks).

### "manualImportLinks" - `[Object, ...]`

This stores information about import links between files that the user has created via drag-and-drop in CodeKit's UI. When parsing a Config File, you should treat this value as an opaque `Array` and write it, unmodified, to your output. When creating a Config File from scratch, you should omit this property. (Drag-and-drop import links are a legacy feature from a time before ES6 module syntax.)

### "projectAttributes" - `{"key": value, ...}`

This is an `Object` that stores basic biographical information about a Project. [See Details](#project-attributes)

### "projectSettings" - `{"key": value, ...}`

This is an `Object` that stores the Project Settings for this Project. It contains configuration for tooling such as ESLint, Babel, Autoprefixer, etc. It also provides "default" values to fall back on when a file in `files` (above) is missing a value for a particular setting. If that value is *also* missing from `projectSettings`, CodeKit falls back to the "Defaults for New Projects" that the user has specified. At that level, **every** possible setting is guaranteed to have a value. [See Details](#project-settings)

### "settingsFileVersion" - `String` (REQUIRED)

Pass the `String` `"3"` for this value. CodeKit will ignore any Config File that is missing this value.

# Project Attributes

This top-level property is an `Object` that contains basic biographical information about a Project. It looks like this:

```javascript
"projectAttributes": {
   "creationDate": 586072330.73522604,
   "displayValue": "The Project Name As Shown in CodeKit's UI",
   "displayValueWasSetByUser": 0,
   "iconImageName": "brackets_purple",
   "iconImageWasSetByUser": 0
}
```

### "creationDate" - `Double`

The date the project was created. Stored as the number of seconds since `00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 2001` in `Double` format. If you omit this property, CodeKit will set it to whatever date the user first added this Project to the app, which is probably what you want.

### "displayValue" - `String`

The name of the Project as it appears in the UI. If this is omitted, the name of the Project Root Folder will be used.

### "displayValueWasSetByUser" - `Integer`

If `0`, CodeKit will keep `displayValue` in sync with the Project Root Folder name (as the user renames the folder, the `displayValue` will be updated to match). If `1`, renaming the folder has no effect on `displayValue`. If you omit this value, it defaults to `0`.

### "iconImageName" - `String`

This is *either* the name of a default Project Icon Image from the list below **OR** a relative path from the Project Root Folder to the image (JPG or PNG) that should be used as the Project Icon. If you supply a relative path, it **MUST** begin with a `/`.

If the specified image does not exist or you omit this property, CodeKit randomly selects a default icon. NOTE: If you want to maintain an exact icon, be sure to set `iconImageWasSetByUser` to `1`.

The available Project Icon Names that are bundled into CodeKit are:

* brackets_brown
* brackets_gray
* brackets_orange
* brackets_green
* brackets_magenta
* brackets_purple
* brackets_teal
* brackets-brick
* brackets-forest
* brackets-koamaru
* brackets-pink
* brackets-red
* brackets-slime
* brackets-ucla
* brackets-unblue
* brackets-glace
* brackets-pale
* brackets-payne
* brackets-silver
* brackets-tar
* brackets-azure

* meme-maroney
* meme-crying
* meme-confession
* meme-doge
* meme-jake
* meme-ron
* meme-confusedBaby
* meme-angryBaby
* meme-yesBaby

### "iconImageWasSetByUser" - `Integer`

If `0`, CodeKit will automatically set an `apple-touch-icon.png` or `favicon` image as the Project Icon whenever it finds one anywhere in the Project. If `1`, `iconImageName` will not be changed when the app finds one of these files. If you omit this value, it defaults to `0`.

# Files

#### Discussion
This top-level property contains settings for each individual file in the Project. In CodeKit, every file has its own settings, which provides flexibility—one file can be set to minify while another does not, etc. 

When a new file is added to a Project for the first time, it won't have an entry in this object. Its initial settings are populated from whichever `languageDefaults` property of `projectSettings` is appropriate (based on file type). If `projectSettings` is missing an entry for a given `languageDefaults`, CodeKit falls back to the settings the user has specified under "Defaults For New Projects" within the app. At that level, **every** setting is guaranteed to have a value.

When creating a Config File, you may find it faster to specify *only* the file-by-file settings that differ from the `projectSettings` you have specified.

When *parsing* a Config File, you should never discard information from this object, as the user may have customized settings on a file-by-file basis and those customiziations would be lost (and restored to Project Settings values) if you discarded this object.

#### The Files Object

The files object is keyed by the **relative** path from the Project Root Folder to each file. The path **MUST** begin with a `/`. The exact keys in each file's object depend on the type of file. Here is an example for an `SCSS` file:

```javascript
"files": {
    "/subfolder/file.scss": {
		"aP": 0,
		"bl": 0,
		"dP": 5,
		"dS": 0,
		"ft": 4,
		"ma": 0,
		"oA": 2,
		"oAP": "/build/subfolder/file.css",
		"oF": 0,
		"oS": 0,
		"uL": 1
		},
    "/someOtherFile.js": {
      ...
    }
}
```

### Why Are The Keys Abbreviated?
Because in Projects with tens of thousands of files, the extra characters add megabytes to the size of the Config File. 

.  
.  
.  

## Keys Shared By All Files
All files have the following keys, regardless of their type:


### "ft" — `Integer`

This stands for "File Type". It is one of the `Integer` values from the table below. CodeKit uses this (along with other heuristics) to determine the "absolute truth" about a file's type. (A file's extension alone is not a reliable indicator because, for example, `*.js` and `*.jsm` and `*.es6` can all mean "JavaScript".)

**CRITICAL:** If you are parsing the Config File in JavaScript, you must use `BigInt` to represent this value, as it may contain a value that is larger than `2^53`. If you are writing a Config File from scratch, you must use `BigInt` to represent this number for all values larger than `2^53`


| File Type             |  Extension | Value | Raw Value |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ----- | --------- |
| Less                  | .less      | 2^0   | 1         |
| Sass                  | .sass      | 2^1   | 2         |
| SCSS                  | .scss      | 2^2   | 4         |
| Stylus                | .styl      | 2^3   | 8         |
| CSS                   | .css       | 2^4   | 16        |
| CoffeeScript          | .coffee    | 2^5   | 32        |
| Literate CoffeeScript | .litcoffee | 2^18  | 262144    |
| JavaScript            | .js        | 2^6   | 64        | 
| TypeScript            | .ts        | 2^7   | 128       |
| Haml                  | .haml      | 2^8   | 256       |
| Pug                   | .pug       | 2^9   | 512       |
| Slim                  | .slim      | 2^10  | 1024      |
| Kit                   | .kit       | 2^11  | 2048      |
| Markdown              | .md, .mmd  | 2^12  | 4096      |
| Other*                | [N/A]      | 2^13  | 8192      |
| JPEG                  | .jpg, .jpeg| 2^14  | 16384     |
| PNG                   | .png       | 2^15  | 32768     |
| SVG                   | .svg       | 2^21  | 2097152   |
| GIF                   | .gif       | 2^22  | 4194304   |
| JSON                  | .json      | 2^19  | 524288    |
| Folder (Directory)    | [N/A]      | 2^16  | 65536     |


#### The "Other" File Type:
This is used for any type of file that is not otherwise listed above. It represents files for which CodeKit has no specific built-in processing. Examples: `.php`, `.html`, `.xml`, `.rb`, etc.

#### Sass vs SCSS:
Note that CodeKit uses two different `ft` values to represent `*.scss` and `*.sass` files. This is done so that the app is future-proof in case Sass and SCSS files ever adopt different, exclusive options.

#### The "Folder" Type:
Users can tell CodeKit to skip indexing a particular folder. They do this when the folder contains too many items that aren't relevant and indexing it would take a long time (e.g. `node_modules` folders). When the user does this, CodeKit does not store settings for each file in the folder, nor does it display those files in the UI. Instead, it asks the user what should be done with this folder (and its contents) when the Project builds—should the folder be ignored, or should it be copied into the build directory? To store this setting, an entry in the `files` object may have the value `65536` for `ft`, which means it refers to a folder instead of a file.

#### Reserved Values:
Do not use any value that is not explicitly listed in the table above. Doing so will cause CodeKit to ignore the entire settings object for that particular file.



### "oA" - `Integer`

This stands for "Output Action". It specifies what CodeKit will do when a given file changes on disk or is processed during a Build. The value is one of:

| Value  | Action          | Details |
| ------ | --------------- | ------- |
| 0      | Compile/Process | CodeKit will process this file on change and during Builds. If the file is of a type for which CodeKit does not have built-in processing AND the user has not specified a Hook to handle this type of file, the file will be copied to its output path as-is.
| 1      | Ignore          | On file-change and during Builds, this file will not be processed, but any files that import it will be.
| 2      | Copy            | On file-change and during Builds, CodeKit will copy this file as-is to its Output Path, **without** any processing/compiling.



### "oAP" - `String`

This stands for "Output Abbreviated Path". It is the relative path from the Project Root Folder to the Output File you want to create when the given file is processed. It **MUST** begin with a `/`.

Note: CodeKit *does* allow setting an Output Path to a location outside of the Project Root Folder, but that is extremely discouraged. If the `OutputPathIsOutsideProject` flag is set, CodeKit will interpret the path provided here as relative to the disk root instead of the Project Root Folder.


### "oF" - `Integer`

This stands for "Output Flags". It is a **bitmask** (a single number where the value of each bit represents a boolean). The default value is `0`. Currently, only the first three bits are used:


| Bit Position    | Name                       | Explanation     |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| 0               | OutputActionWasSetByUser   | CodeKit automatically changes a file's Output Action to `ignore` when that file is imported into others. If the value of this bit is `1`, the app will not automatically change the Output Action. CodeKit sets this bit to `1` anytime the user explicitly chooses an Output Action for the file in the UI.
| 1               | OutputPathWasSetByUser     | CodeKit adjusts a file's Output Path automatically when the file is renamed, moved, or when the Build folder is enabled/disabled. If this bit is set to `1`, the Output Path is locked; it will not be automatically adjusted. This bit is set to `1` when a user explicitly sets an Output Path for a file or clicks the "lock" button in CodeKit's UI.
| 2               | OutputPathIsOutsideProject | If this bit is set to `1`, CodeKit interprets the path supplied for the `oAP` property as relative to the disk root instead of the Project Root Folder.

## Less Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, Less files have these keys:


### "aP" - `Integer`

`Autoprefixer` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run Autoprefixer on the compiled CSS file. If the value is `0`, CodeKit will *not* run Autoprefixer.


### "bl" - `Integer`

`Bless` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run Bless on the compiled CSS file. If the value is `0`, CodeKit will *not* run Bless.


### "eJ" - `Integer`

`Enable JavaScript` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will set the Less compiler's "Enable JavaScript" option to true. If the value is `0`, that option will be set to false.


### "ie" - `Integer`

`IE Compatibility` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will enable the "IE Compatibility" option on the Less compiler. If it is `0`, that option will be set to false.


### "iI" - `Integer`

`Insecure Imports` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will enable the "Allow Insecure Imports" option on the Less compiler. If it is `0`, that option will be set to false.


### "ma" - `Integer`

`Source Map` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will create a source map when compiling this file. If the value is `0`, it will *not* create a source map.


### "mS" - `Integer`

`Math Style` This value controls which "Math Style" CodeKit enables for the Less compiler, which defines when the compiler performs math operations (see the Less docs for details). It is one of these values:

| Value             |  Math Style                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0                 | Always Except Division Requires Parens  |
| 1                 | Always                                  |
| 2                 | Only Inside Parens                      |
| 3                 | Strict-Legacy (Deprecated)              |


### "oS" - `Integer`

`Output Style` This controls which output style the Less compiler uses. It is one of these values:

| Value             |  Output Style         |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | Regular               |
| 1                 | Compressed (Minified) |


### "rwU" - `Integer`

`Rewrite URLs` This value determines which setting CodeKit passes to the Less compiler for the "rewrite URLs" option. It is one of these values:

| Value             |  Output Style          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0                 | Do not rewrite URLs    |
| 1                 | Rewrite ALL URLs       |
| 2                 | Rewrite only local URLs|


### "sI" - `Integer`

`Strict Imports` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will enable the "strict imports" Less compiler option when compiling this file. If the value is `0`, this compiler option is set to false.


### "sU" - `Integer`

`Strict Units` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will enable the "strict units" Less compiler option when compiling this file. If the value is `0`, this compiler option is set to false.


.  
.

## Sass and SCSS Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, Sass and SCSS files have these keys:


### "aP" - `Integer`

`Autoprefixer` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run Autoprefixer on the compiled CSS file. If the value is `0`, CodeKit will *not* run Autoprefixer.


### "bl" - `Integer`

`Bless` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run Bless on the compiled CSS file. If the value is `0`, CodeKit will *not* run Bless.

### "dP" - `Integer`

`Decimal Precision` This is the value passed to the Sass compiler for the "Decimal Precision" option. It should be between `0` and `10`. 


### "dS" - `Integer`

`Debug Style` This value controls which "Debug Style" CodeKit enables for the Sass compiler. It is one of these values:

| Value             |  Debug Style                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0                 | None                                    |
| 1                 | Print line numbers above selectors      |
| 2                 | Print full debug info                   |


### "ma" - `Integer`

`Source Map` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will create a source map when compiling this file. If the value is `0`, it will *not* create a source map.


### "oS" - `Integer`

`Output Style` This controls which output style the Sass compiler uses. It is one of these values:

| Value             |  Output Style         |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | Nested                |
| 1                 | Expanded              |
| 2                 | Compact               |
| 3                 | Compressed            |


### "uL" - `Integer`

`Use Libsass` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will use the Libsass compiler. If it is `0`, CodeKit will use the legacy Sass compiler. (Libsass is the default and is highly recommended.)

.  
.  
.  


## Stylus Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, Stylus files have these keys:


### "aP" - `Integer`

`Autoprefixer` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run Autoprefixer on the compiled CSS file. If the value is `0`, CodeKit will *not* run Autoprefixer.


### "bl" - `Integer`

`Bless` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run Bless on the compiled CSS file. If the value is `0`, CodeKit will *not* run Bless.


### "dS" - `Integer`

`Debug Style` This value controls which "Debug Style" CodeKit enables for the Stylus compiler. It is one of these values:

## CSS Keys

Note: CodeKit allows users to process CSS files with Libsass to minify them, etc. (A CSS file may create another CSS file.) CSS files may also be the output of a Sass, Less, or Stylus file. In all cases, CodeKit stores the same properties for every CSS file—it simply does not use them when the CSS file is an output file.

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, CSS files have these keys:


### "aP" - `Integer`

`Autoprefixer` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run Autoprefixer on the CSS file. If the value is `0`, CodeKit will *not* run Autoprefixer.


### "bl" - `Integer`

`Bless` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run Bless on the CSS file. If the value is `0`, CodeKit will *not* run Bless.


### "ma" - `Integer`

`Source Map` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will create a source map when compiling this file. If the value is `0`, it will *not* create a source map.


### "oS" - `Integer`

`Output Style` This controls which output style the Libsass compiler uses when processing this CSS file. It is one of these values:

| Value             |  Output Style         |

.  
.  
.  

## CoffeeScript Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, CoffeeScript files have these keys. **NOTE:** These keys apply to both `*.coffee` and `*.litcoffee` file types.


### "ma" - `Integer`

`Source Map` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will create a source map when compiling this file. If the value is `0`, it will *not* create a source map.

| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | None                  |
| 1                 | Babel                 |

.  
.  
.  

## JavaScript Keys

Note: CodeKit does not process JavaScript files in-place. That is, a JS file is processed and creates another JS file at a separate path. Some JS files will therefore be "output files" produced by other JS files. CodeKit stores these properties for every JS file—they simply are not used for output files.

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, JavaScript files have these keys:

### "ma" - `Integer`

`Source Map` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will create a source map when processing this file. If the value is `0`, it will *not* create a source map.


### "mi" - `Integer`

`Minify Output` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will minify the output file using TerserJS, after transpiling and bundling are complete (if either is performed). If the value is `0`, the output file will not be minified.


### "sC" - `Integer`

`Syntax Checker Type` This tells CodeKit which syntax checker to run when processing this file. It is one of the values below. You should **strongly** prefer ESLint over JSHint or JSLint.

| 2                 | JSLint                |
| 3                 | ESLint                |


### "tS" - `Integer`

`Transpiler Style` This tells CodeKit which transpiler to run on this file. It is one of these values:

| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | None                  |
| 1                 | Babel                 |


### "bF" - `Integer`

`Bundle Format` This value determines whether CodeKit runs RollupJS to bundle ES6 imports in this file and, if so, specifies the format of that bundle. It is one of these values:

| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | None (Do not bundle)  |
| 1                 | AMD                   |
| 2                 | CommonJS              |
| 3                 | ESModule              |
| 4                 | IIFE                  |
| 5                 | SystemJS              |
| 6                 | UMD                   |

## HAML Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, HAML files have these keys:

### "cB" - `Integer`

`Run Cache Buster` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will scan the compiled Output File for URLs and append a query parameter to each URL that loads a resource. This forces browsers to load the resource from disk rather than serve an outdated, cached copy. If the value is `0`, this step is not performed. 


### "cDA" - `Integer`

`Use CDATA` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will enable the "Use CDATA" option on the HAML compiler. If the value is `0`, that option will be set to false.

.  
.  
.  



## Pug Keys

**NOTE:** CodeKit treats `*.jade` files as `*.pug` files, but compiles the former files with the legacy Jade compiler. The settings are the same for both types of files.

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, Pug files have these keys:


### "cB" - `Integer`

`Run Cache Buster` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will scan the compiled Output File for URLs and append a query parameter to each URL that loads a resource. This forces browsers to load the resource from disk rather than serve an outdated, cached copy. If the value is `0`, this step is not performed. 


### "cOD" - `Integer`

## Kit Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, Kit files have these keys:

### "cB" - `Integer`

`Run Cache Buster` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will scan the compiled Output File for URLs and append a query parameter to each URL that loads a resource. This forces browsers to load the resource from disk rather than serve an outdated, cached copy. If the value is `0`, this step is not performed. 


### "hM" - `Integer`

`Run HTML Minifier` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run the compiled Output File through an HTML Minifier. If the value is `0`, that will not be done. Kit files can compile to **any** type (not just HTML), so enabling this option is only appropriate if the Output File is HTML.

.  
.  
.  



## Markdown Keys

**NOTE:** CodeKit uses the MultiMarkdown compiler, which adds unique features to Markdown. The available options reflect this.

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, Markdown files have these keys:


### "cB" - `Integer`

`Run Cache Buster` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will scan the compiled Output File for URLs and append a query parameter to each URL that loads a resource. This forces browsers to load the resource from disk rather than serve an outdated, cached copy. If the value is `0`, this step is not performed. 


### "cS" - `Integer`

`Run HTML Minifier` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run the compiled Output File through an HTML Minifier. If the value is `0`, that will not be done. MultiMarkdown files can compile to several types (not just HTML), so enabling this option is only appropriate if the Output File is HTML.


### "oFM" - `Integer`

`Output Format` This controls the type of output file that MMD produces when compiling. It is one of these values:

| Value             | Output Format         |

## JPEG Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, JPEG files have these keys:


### "iS" - `Integer`

`Initial Size` This is the size, in bytes, that the JPEG file was the first time CodeKit saw it. (CodeKit allows users to optimize images in-place, so the current size of the file is not necessarily its initial size.)


### "jF" - `Integer`

`JPEG Output Format` This determines what type of rendering the optimized JPEG will have. It is one of these values:

| Value             | Format                |

| 2                 | Progressive           |


### "oIPL" - `Integer`

`Optimized In Place Lossy` If this value is `1`, this JPEG file has already been optimized in-place with lossy optimization (some quality reduction took place). If the value is `0`, the file has not previously been optimized in-place with lossy compression. CodeKit uses this value to warn the user before optimizing an image in-place multiple times with lossy compression.


### "opt" - `Integer`

`Optimized` If this value is `1`, this JPEG file has already been optimized in-place, but that optimization was lossless (no reduction in quality occurred). If the value is `0`, the file has not previously been losslessly optimized in-place.


### "q" - `Integer`

`Quality` This is a value between `0` and `100`, which specifies how aggressive to be when performing lossy optimizations. Higher values retain image quality, lower values sacrifice quality for smaller files. In general, values around `85` produce satisfactory images with 50-70% size reductions.

## PNG Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, PNG files have these keys:


### "iS" - `Integer`

`Initial Size` This is the size, in bytes, that the PNG file was the first time CodeKit saw it. (CodeKit allows users to optimize images in-place, so the current size of the file is not necessarily its initial size.)


### "oIPL" - `Integer`

`Optimized In Place Lossy` If this value is `1`, this PNG file has already been optimized in-place with lossy optimization (some quality reduction took place). If the value is `0`, the file has not previously been optimized in-place with lossy compression. CodeKit uses this value to warn the user before optimizing an image in-place multiple times with lossy compression.


### "opt" - `Integer`

`Optimized` If this value is `1`, this PNG file has already been previously optimized in-place, but that optimization was lossless (no reduction in quality occurred). If the value is `0`, the file has not previously been losslessly optimized in-place.


### "oT" - `Integer`

`Optimizer Type` This specifies which PNG Optimizer should be used to process this file. **NOTE**: This value is a bitmask (each bit represents a Boolean on/off). To enable a specific optimizer, you set the bit in that position to `1`. To disable that optimizer, you set the bit to `0`. There are currently only two optimizers. To run *only* PNGQuant, set the value of `oT` to `0`. To run *only* OptiPNG, set it to `1`.

| Bit Position      | Optimizer             |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | PNGQuant              |
| 1                 | OptiPNG               |


### "q" - `Integer`

`Quality` This is a value between `0` and `100`, which specifies how aggressive to be when performing lossy optimizations. Higher values retain image quality, lower values sacrifice quality for smaller files. In general, anything above `80` produces satisfactory images with 50-70% size reductions.

## SVG Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, SVG files have these keys:


### "miP" - `Integer`

`Use MultiPass` If this value is `1`, SVGO will run multiple passes to optimize the file. If the value is `0`, it will run only one pass.


### "opt" - `Integer`

`Optimized` If this value is `1`, this SVG file has already been previously optimized in-place. If the value is `0`, the file has not previously been optimized in-place.


### "plM" - `Integer`

`Plugin Mask` This is a 64-Bit bitmask: each bit of the number functions as a Boolean to turn a specific SVGO plugin on or off. To turn a plugin ON, set the value of the corresponding bit to `1`. To turn a plugin OFF, set the value of the bit to `0`. The plugin associated with each bit appears in the table below.

**WARNING:** If you are parsing the Config File in JavaScript, you must use a `BigInt` for this value. If you are creating a Config File from scatch, you can use the `Number` type as long as you do not need to set any bits over `2^53`.

| Bit Position | SVGO Plugin                                             |

### "pRP" - `Integer`

`Pretty Printed` If this value is `1`, SVGO will produce output that is human-readable. If the value is `0`, the output will be minified.

## GIF Keys

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, GIF files have these keys:


### "iS" - `Integer`

`Initial Size` This is the size, in bytes, that the GIF file was the first time CodeKit saw it. (CodeKit allows users to optimize images in-place, so the current size of the file is not necessarily its initial size.)


### "opt" - `Integer`

`Optimized` If this value is `1`, this GIF file has already been previously optimized in-place, but that optimization was lossless (no reduction in quality occurred). If the value is `0`, the file has not previously been losslessly optimized in-place.

## Keys For Folder File Types

The Folder type has no additional keys other than the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files.

.  
.  
.  



## Keys For Other File Types

In addition to the [shared keys](#keys-shared-by-all-files) common to all files, files of "Other" type have these keys:


### "cB" - `Integer`

`Run Cache Buster` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will scan this file for URLs and append a query parameter to each URL that loads a resource. This forces browsers to load the resource from disk rather than serve an outdated, cached copy. If the value is `0`, this step is not performed. 


### "hM" - `Integer`

`Run HTML Minifier` If this value is `1`, CodeKit will run this file through an HTML Minifier. If the value is `0`, that will not be done. Enabling this option is appropriate only if the file is HTML.

# Project Settings

This is a `{"key": value, ...}` Object that stores a massive amount configuration options. There are several main "sections" to Project Settings:

* **Top-Level Settings** - These are top-level key/value pairs on the Project Settings object. 

* **Language Defaults** - When a new file is added to the Project, these objects store the initial settings that should be used for that file. These initial settings are also used as a fallback in case a `file` object does not contain a value for a particular setting. There is one of these objects for each type of file that CodeKit supports. There is ALSO one of these objects for each custom langauge the User has added to CodeKit.

.  
.  
.  

## Top-Level Settings


### "abortBuildOnError" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, CodeKit will stop a Build whenever one file has an error. (Warnings do not count as errors.) If the value is `0`, the Build will continue.


### "allowInjectionReloads" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, CodeKit will reload *just* stylesheets when a change occurs that affects only CSS. (It will reload the entire page if a change affects other types of files.) If this value is `0`, CodeKit will reload the entire page everytime a browser refresh is triggered.


### "alwaysUseExternalServer" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, CodeKit's preview server will proxy all requests to the server at the address specified by `externalServerAddress`. If this value is `0`, CodeKit will use its internal HTTP server to handle requests. 


### "animateCSSInjections" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, CodeKit will animate changes to CSS when reloading stylesheets. If the value is `0`, it will not.


### "autoBuildNewItems" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, CodeKit will automatically process/compile new files as they are added to the Project. (This is done *only* if the Project uses a Build folder, since auto-processing files without a Build folder could be destructive.) If the value is `0`, new items are not automatically processed.


### "autoprefixerEnableIEGrid" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, the Autoprefixer "Support for IE Grid" option is enabled when running Autoprefixer. If the value is `0`, that option is set to false.


### "babel7PresetType" - `Integer`

This controls which presets are used when running Babel. The value is a bitmask—each bit represents a boolean that controls a specific preset, as depicted in the table below. To turn a preset ON, set the corresponding bit to `1`. To turn a preset OFF, set the corresponding bit to `0`. (The default value is `1`, which enables the `ENV` preset.)

| Bit Position      | Babel Preset          |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | ENV                   |
| 1                 | React                 |
| 2                 | Flow                  |


### "babelAllowRCFiles" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, Babel will look for and load `.babelrc` files while transpiling. If the value is `0`, those files will be ignored.


### "babelAuxiliaryCommentAfter" - `String`

This `String` is written after each change that Babel makes in transpiled code. The default value is an empty string: `""`


### "babelAuxiliaryCommentBefore" - `String`

This `String` is written before each change that Babel makes in transpiled code. The default value is an empty string: `""`


### "babelConfigType" - `Integer`

This controls where Babel gets its configuration. It is one of these values:

| Value             | Description           |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | Auto - Babel selects which plugins to use based on the BrowsersList string. (Babel-Preset-ENV) |
| 1                 | Manual - The plugins and presets specified by the user in CodeKit's UI are used.               |
| 2                 | Config File - All configuration options from CodeKit are ignored and the user is responsible for configuring Babel with a Babel configuration file in the Project. |


### "babelCustomPluginsList" - `String`

This is a comma-separated list of additional plugins that should be passed to Babel. The user is responsible for installing these plugins in a `node_modules` folder within the Project. The default value is an empty string: `""`

### "babelCustomPresetList" - `String`

This is a comma-separated list of additional presets that should be passed to Babel. The user is responsible for installing these presets in a `node_modules` folder within the project. The default value is an empty string: `""`


### "babelExcludeString" - `String`

This is a comma-separated list of regex patterns that are passed to Babel as paths/items to skip when transpiling. The default value excludes any item with a path component matching `node_modules`, `core-js`, or `bower_components`: `"/\\/node_modules\\//, /\\/core-js\\//, /\\/bower_components\\//"`


### "babelInsertModuleIDs" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, Babel will insert module IDs during transpiling. If the value is `0`, it will not.


### "babelModuleID" - `String`

This `String` specifies the module ID to insert if `babelInsertModuleIDs` is `1`. The default value is an empty string: `""`


### "babelNoComments" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, Babel will not insert auxiliary comments. If it is `0`, the comments specified in `babelAuxiliaryCommentAfter` and `babelAuxiliaryCommentBefore` will be inserted.


### "babelPlugins" - `{"key": {"key": value}, ...}`

This is a list of all the standard Babel Plugins (those bundled with CodeKit) and whether they are enabled/disabled for this Project. Each entry in this Object looks like this:

```javascript
"babelPlugins": {
	"arrow-functions": {
		"active": 0
	},
	...
}
```

Entries are keyed by the name of a specific plugin from the list below. If the plugin should be used when Babel runs, the `active` property is set to `1`. If the plugin should NOT be used when Babel runs, set the `active` property to `0`. Do not add any items other than those in the list below. To set custom plugins, use `babelCustomPluginsList`.

**NOTE:** By default, Babel auto-selects which plugins to use based on the Browsers specified in the BrowsersList string. If you want to manually specify which plugins to run, you must set the `babelConfigType` property to `1`.

List of Babel plugin names to use:

### "babelRetainLines" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, Babel will attempt to keep line numbers the same during transpiling. If the value is `0`, it will not.


### "babelUseBuiltInsType" -  `Integer`

This controls the `useBuiltIns` Babel option. It is one of these values:

| Value             | UseBuiltIns Option    |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 0                 | False                 |
| 1                 | Entry                 |
| 2                 | Usage                 |


### "bowerAbbreviatedPath" - `String`

This `String` provides the relative path from the Project Root Folder to the folder where Bower should install components. The default is `"bower_components"`, which will create a subfolder with that name in the Project Root Folder.


### "bowerForceLatestOnConflict" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, Bower will automatically use the latest version of a component when a conflict arises. If the value is `0`, Bower will output an error and refuse to continue until the user resolves the conflict manually.


### "bowerTargetDependencyListType" - `Integer`

This controls to which dependency list in the `bower.json` an installed component is added. It is one of these values:

| Value             | Dependency List       |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| 1                 | Production            |
| 2                 | Development           |


### "bowerUseExactVersion" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, when a component is installed, the `bower.json` file will specify that the **exact** version installed is required. If the value is `0`, the `bower.json` file will use a semantic version string that allows any newer version of the component, up to but not including any version where the first non-zero version number has changed.


### "browserRefreshDelay" - `Integer`

This is the number of seconds that CodeKit will wait between the end of processing a file and issuing a command to refresh browsers. It is useful for people working on remote servers, where there is a lag between the time a file finishes processing and the time it finishes uploading to the remote server's disk. The default value is `0`. The maximum value is `10`.


### "browserslistString" - `String`

This `String` is used by Autoprefixer and Babel (if Babel is set to auto-configure itself). The value **MUST** be a valid browserslist string or Autoprefixer and Babel will fail to run.


### "buildFolderActive" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, this Project uses a Build Folder. If the value is `0`, it does not. **NOTE:** When this setting is toggled in CodeKit, the app automatically adjusts every file's Output Path by either adding or removing the `buildFolderName` to the beginning of the Output Path, as appropriate. If you change this setting manually, YOU are responsible for making sure the Output Path of each file (or the `lanagugeDefaults` object used to automatically set Output Paths on each type of file) are set appropriately. 


### "buildFolderName" - `String`

This is the name of the Build folder. It cannot be an empty string. The default value is `"build"`.


### "cleanBuild" - `Integer`

If this value is `1`, CodeKit will delete everything in the Build folder before beginning a new Build. If the value is `0`, existing items will not be deleted when a new build starts.


### "coffeeLintFlags2" - `

# Build Steps
This is the top-level property named `buildSteps`, which is an `Array` of `{"string": value}`. There are currently three types of Build Steps:

* "run a script" 
* "process specific files"
* "process all remaining files" 

The `buildSteps` Array may contain any number of the first two types and **exactly one** of the third type. The order matters; it is the order in which the user expects the steps to execute. Each type of Build Step has a slightly different structure:
